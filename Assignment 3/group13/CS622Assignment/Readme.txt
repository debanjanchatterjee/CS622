1) Download pin tool 3.15 and setup 
2)Create a directory named CS622Assignment under pin-3.15-98253-gb56e429b1-gcc-linux/source/tools/.
3)Copy prog1.c, prog2.c, prog3.c, prog4.c, makefile, makefile.rules into this directory.
4)Copy the contents of given assignment into the folder 

NOTE:[just copy the entire CS622 assignment folder submitted into the pin-3.15-98253-gb56e429b1-gcc-linux/source/tools/]

5)execute the python3 script1.py

6)the prog1.out,prog2.out,prog3.out,prog4.out has the necessary threadwise memory access trace (approx time taken:25-30mins)
7)the trace_count.out has the total count of traces in each of the binaries after passed through the addrtrace.cpp

8)Run python3 script2.py for the simulator to run


Requirements: 8GB RAM,python3
9) Time Taken: (approx: 7-8hrs+) for prog1 [due to large file generation and transferring into inputQueue]
		(approx: 20mins) for prog2
 		(approx: 1.5 hrs) for prog3
 		(approx: 5 mins) for prog4
 		
10) Nack Counter = 1 (as any value below 20 is to be taken , for simplicity 1 is taken)
